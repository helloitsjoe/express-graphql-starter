# Express GraphQL Starter

Starter kit for a React app running an Express server with a graphql endpoint

## Branches

- `master`: Vanilla React implementation to interact with GraphQL backend
- `apollo`: Uses Apollo's `graphql` HOC to interact with the backend
- `apollo-hoks`: Uses `useQuery` and `useMutation` to interact with the backend

Compare branches, and compare tests to see how things have been implemented differently.
